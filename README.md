This is the final project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. We developed a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories (React, Redux and Udacity), comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to interact with the front-end portion of the project.

To get started started:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
